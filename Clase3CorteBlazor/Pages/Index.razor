       <MudText> Well in 10 years I expect to be a informatic engineer with a PhD on machine learning and statistics, 
    I also want to explore the front end aspect of coding, I really want to be a front end design because I always have this fixation on design
    now I know how to design in Adobe illustrator and photoshop and I expect to get better in this two programs because I know a can do It, also I expect  
    lot of this in the technology world, I want to see how the portable phones just evolve into machines that helps us and get involve in our daily life, also 
    I want to see how the artificial intelligence just grew up as the replacement of humans in works that a robot or a machine would do it faster and cheaper. 
    In my personal life I want to live in silicon valley and work for a big company, like java or maybe Riot Games, that is the enterprise of my favorite MMO, 
    game, I really want to design for them or maybe code the game and be into the development of League of Legends, just because I have played this videogame, since
    I was a little kid, and I really felt in love of his structure and the way it helps me to forgive about everything. Continuing with the main purpose of this essay
    I really want to know and I see my self in 10 years as a successfully professional in the aspect that I would like to reach, even if is in front end or in machine
    learning aspect, I see myself with technology,  in a good relationship in my house I expect to all of the house be completely automatized all with voice commands,
    right now I just have an Alexa on my house that controls the lights in my apartment and the alarms that wake me up, I the next years I want to all my house is automatized,
    the curtains, the stove and well basically of the tasks that I just don’t want to do it and machines and the artificial intelligence just can do it for me. I want also to
    life in a different way, like my phone not to be a piece of metal and just to be maybe a screen were the holograms just do the task of showing things in front of you
    without needing a projector that nowadays is always big and uncomfortable to show things in causal days. Maybe I want to see the evolution of cryptocurrency and how is
    going to be the real money or if everything is going to be paid by electronic way. Maybe is going to evolve in the best way making paying and transactions way easier
    than now. In 10 years I want to see myself in a futuristic world and society were all the people is really linked with how it works every piece of technology, because
    I think that even we are in the 21 century, there is people that don’t really like or are involved in the technology world and how it works perfectly in the human life,
    because I think is a tool that we as humans need to use to just get our life easier, and technology has demonstrated all this in several years, now we have cars that are 
    fully operated by a machine, as Tesla cars, that are fully drive by an artificial machine, and that just blows my mind. Something that I also want it to explore and see
    me in the next 10 years is how DNA link with the technology is curious to be maybe DNA modificated and well is also a moral dilemma, but I really want to know how it 
    works and how it could be someone that by the technology way is created and how it works. Finally talking about more of my personal life, linked with technology I just
    want it to say that I expect a lot of things, I expect to work in something that can roll my life in the cutting-edge technology, with also maybe a family that also 
    likes the thinks that I like and supports me in the way that they can also work in help the world with their creation.
